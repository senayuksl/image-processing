# Image Processing Project

This project is a MATLAB-based image processing application where various image manipulation techniques are applied to an image chosen by the user. The application allows users to apply several filters and effects on the image, including:

- Displaying only selected primary and secondary colors.
- Applying **blurring** filters.
- Applying **sharpening** filters.
- Converting the image to **grayscale**.
- Creating a **negative** of the image.

These operations provide insight into fundamental image processing methods and their visual effects on images.

## Features

1. **Color Filtering**: 
   - Select primary or secondary colors (e.g., red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow) to display only the chosen color in the image while suppressing the others.
   - Useful for isolating specific color information in the image.

2. **Blurring**: 
   - Apply various blurring techniques such as Gaussian blur to smooth the image and reduce noise.
   - Can be used for reducing detail or creating artistic effects.

3. **Sharpening**: 
   - Enhance the edges and details in the image using sharpening filters.
   - Helps in emphasizing important features of the image.

4. **Grayscale Conversion**: 
   - Convert the image from its color format to grayscale.
   - Simplifies the image by reducing it to shades of gray, useful for further analysis or stylization.

5. **Negative Conversion**: 
   - Convert the image into its negative, inverting the colors to create an opposite color effect.
   - Useful for certain artistic applications or highlighting contrast.

## How It Works

1. **Image Selection**: The user selects an image file to upload. The image can be in various formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.

2. **Filter Application**: 
   - The user can choose the desired operation from the available filters (color selection, blur, sharpen, grayscale, negative).
   - Each filter is applied in real-time, allowing the user to see the effect on the image immediately.

3. **Result Display**: The modified image is displayed, showing the effects of the selected image processing technique.
